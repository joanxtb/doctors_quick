# Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project:

2. **Install Dependencies**  
    Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Development Server**  
    Launch the application locally:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    or if you want to test it on a different device at the same network
    ```bash
    npm run local
    ```

4. **Build for Production**  
    To create a production build, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

For further assistance, refer to the project documentation or contact the maintainer @joanxtb

5. ** AI used in this project
    We only used Copilot AI for Component boilerplate and code completion. Also
    because the data is mostly 'Mocked', Copilot helped a creating snippets that
    auto-generates that data.

6. ** About Cursor AI.
    Honestly I didn't knew about it, and when I went into it, they said that is
    in its early steps, and needs to enter a queue in order to have access to it. 
    Discarded it inmediatelly.

7. ** Know limitations
    This project is not using any SSR tool (like Next.js). Therefore, their SEO capabilities
    are next to none. This would be next steps.

8. ** Integration tests
    I will try to implement some before the timecap.
